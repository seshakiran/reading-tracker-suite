Companies that miss disruption often fail because their CEOs and leadership teams are blind to the fundamental changes happening in their industries. This article examines the strategic mistakes that led to the downfall of once-dominant companies and the lessons we can learn from their failures.

The history of business strategy shows us that successful companies often become victims of their own success. When companies reach market leadership, they develop institutional blindness to emerging threats. This strategic myopia happens because leadership teams focus on existing customers and proven business models.

Strategic thinking about disruption involves understanding that competitive advantage comes from anticipating future market changes. Companies that successfully navigate disruption demonstrate several key characteristics including strategic flexibility and adaptability.

The entrepreneurship lesson here is that founders and business leaders must develop pattern recognition for disruption signals. Business model innovation requires companies to experiment with new approaches while maintaining current operations.
